# Address-Book-in-Shell-Script

Shell Scripting is an open-source computer program designed to be run by the Unix/Linux shell. Shell Scripting is a program to write a series of commands for the shell to execute. It can combine lengthy and repetitive sequences of commands into a single and simple script that can be stored and executed anytime which, reduces programming efforts. Shell is a UNIX term for an interface between a user and an operating system service. Shell provides users with an interface and accepts human-readable commands into the system and executes those commands which can run automatically and give the programâ€™s output in a shell script.
In this project we are using Shell Script for making Address Book. The address book comprises of various function like create the record, display, insert, modify and delete the record.
